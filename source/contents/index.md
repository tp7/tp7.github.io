# Hello #

I'm Victor Efimov, more commonly known as tp7. I'm currently a code typist in Russian Far East.
I usually type server-side ASP.NET MVC apps at work but my free typing activities vary from assembly all way up to JavaScript.
My language of preference is C#. I can also use C++ and know a thing or two about Python.

### Things I've done ###
Are almost always terrible. Here's some open source projects I've worked on.

#### AviSynth ####
 1. [Avisynth+][1] - I contributed quite a lot of code to avs+ core filters.
 2. [SangNom2][2] - optimized x64-compatible version of SangNom, reverse-ingeneered from the original closed-source plugin (MarkFD).
 2. [Masktools2][3] - refactored and somewhat optimized fork of masktools2 (Manao).
 3. [FTurn][4] - fast turnleft/turnright/turn180 functions, now included in avs+ core.
 4. [Checkmate][5] - rainbow removal tool, rewritten version of the original plugin (MarkFD).
 5. [Average][6] - simple plugin for averaging any number of clips.
 6. [RgTools][7] - Removegrain, Repair, Clense and VerticalCleaner (kassandro) replacement, mostly rewritten from scratch because the [original code][8] was insanely bad.
 7. [Vinverse][9] - mostly rewritten version of Vinverse (tritical) with some improvements.
 8. [MSharpen][10] - greatly refactored and optimized version of MSharpen (neuron2).
 9. [TColorMask][11] - simple color masking plugin.
 10. [TMaskCleaner][12] - mask cleaning plugin, based on mt_hysteresis.
 10. [MedianBlur2][13] - [constant time median filter][14] implementation.
 11. [CLExpr][15] - OpenCl plugin for runtime calculation of expressions on 8 and 16-bit depths clips. Makes mt_lutxy and mt_lutxyz possible on 16-bit.

#### Other ####
1. [Sushi][16] - automatic subtitle shifter based on audio streams
2. [WOptiPNG][17] - simple modern [OptiPNG][18] GUI
